Description: This package implements the method for extracting measurements from vowels' formant tracks described in Albin & Rankinen (2014). Every formant point sampled within a vowel is considered as a possible "pivot" (i.e. turning point), with monophthongs modeled as having one pivot and diphthongs modeled as having two pivots. The optimal pivot for the vowel is then determined by fitting regression lines to the formant trajectory and comparing the goodness-of-fit of these lines to the raw formant data. Vowels can either be described in terms of F1 and F2 alone or in terms of F1, F2, and F3. In addition to formants, the functions can also be applied to any one-dimensional time-series of acoustic measurements (F0, intensity, nasality, breathiness, center of gravity, spectral tilt, etc.) by providing that vector as 'f1' and leaving 'f2' and  'f3' unspecified.
